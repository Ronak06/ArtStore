# ArtStore

ArtStore is comprised of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. It is a application created for a Web Application course during my 3rd Year at University. The premise of the application is to display famous Artwork, Artists, and Musuems. Clicking on each of the following drop-downs (Artwork, Artists, Musuems) provides further information on the topic. A shopping cart on the navigation bar at the top of the application allows you purchase any of the Artworks and provide Shipping information for said purchase.


The application was built in a group of three: Gurkirat Singh, Manrag Nagra, Ronak Patel.
